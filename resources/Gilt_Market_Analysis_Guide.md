## Interest Rate Swaps Fundamentals

### Basic Structure
Interest rate swaps are contracts where two parties exchange interest rate payments on a notional principal amount. The principal itself is never exchanged - only the interest rate differential.

**Key Components:**
- **Notional Principal**: The reference amount (e.g., £1,000,000) used for calculations
- **Fixed Leg**: One party pays a fixed interest rate
- **Floating Leg**: Other party pays a variable rate (typically SONIA + spread)
- **Tenor**: The life of the swap (e.g., 2, 5, 10, 30 years)

### Example: 10-Year Interest Rate Swap

**Setup:**
- Notional: £1,000,000
- Fixed Rate: 4.20% (current 10Y swap rate)
- Floating Rate: SONIA (currently ~5.25%)
- Payment Frequency: Semi-annual

**Pay-Fixed Swap (equivalent to shorting a bond):**
- You Pay: £21,000 every 6 months (4.20% ÷ 2 × £1M)
- You Receive: SONIA rate ÷ 2 × £1M (varies with each payment)
- Net Effect: If rates rise, you profit; if rates fall, you lose

**Receive-Fixed Swap (equivalent to buying a bond):**
- You Receive: £21,000 every 6 months
- You Pay: SONIA rate ÷ 2 × £1M
- Net Effect: If rates fall, you profit; if rates rise, you lose

## Professional Arbitrage Strategies

### 1. Cash-Swap Arbitrage

**The Opportunity:**
When gilt yields diverge from equivalent swap rates, institutions can capture the spread.

**Example Scenario:**
- 10Y Treasury 4% 2034 gilt yields: 4.35%
- 10Y GBP interest rate swap: 4.20%
- **Arbitrage Spread**: 15 basis points

**Execution:**
1. **Buy the underpriced gilt** at 4.35% yield
2. **Enter pay-fixed swap** at 4.20%
3. **Duration hedge**: Both positions have ~8.5 years duration

**Cash Flow Analysis:**
- **From Gilt**: Receive 4% coupon + capital appreciation to 4.35% yield
- **From Swap**: Pay 4.20% fixed, receive SONIA floating
- **Net Position**: Lock in 15bp spread + (SONIA - gilt coupon) exposure

### 2. Yield Curve Arbitrage

**Concept:**
Exploit mispricing at specific points on the yield curve while hedging duration risk.

**Example:**
- 5Y gilt yields: 4.00% (fair value)
- 10Y gilt yields: 4.35% (15bp cheap vs theoretical 4.20%)
- 20Y gilt yields: 4.50% (fair value)

**Strategy:**
1. **Buy £10M of cheap 10Y gilt**
2. **Sell £5M of 5Y gilt** (or short via repo)
3. **Sell £5M of 20Y gilt** (or short via repo)
4. **Result**: Duration-neutral position capturing 10Y mispricing

### 3. Cross-Market Arbitrage

**Government Bonds vs Corporate Bonds:**
- Buy underpriced gilt at 4.35%
- Sell equivalent-duration corporate bond at 4.25%
- **Risk**: Credit spread widening

**Government Bonds vs Interest Rate Futures:**
- Buy cheap gilt
- Sell gilt futures contracts
- **Profit**: Basis convergence at futures expiry

## Simpler Alternatives for Individual Analysis

### 1. Monitor the Spreads: Track Gilt Yields vs Swap Rates

**What to Track:**
Monitor the spread between gilt yields and equivalent-maturity swap rates across the curve.

**Key Spreads to Watch:**

#### 2-Year Spread (Policy Sensitive)
- **Normal Range**: 5-15 basis points
- **Calculation**: 2Y gilt yield - 2Y GBP swap rate
- **Interpretation**: 
  - **Narrow spreads (5bp)**: Market calm, good liquidity
  - **Wide spreads (25bp+)**: Policy uncertainty or gilt market stress

**Example Analysis:**
```
Date: March 2024
2Y Gilt Yield: 4.45%
2Y GBP Swap: 4.38%
Spread: 7bp (normal)

Date: October 2022 (mini-budget crisis)
2Y Gilt Yield: 4.85%
2Y GBP Swap: 4.25%
Spread: 60bp (extreme stress)
```

#### 10-Year Spread (Benchmark)
- **Normal Range**: 10-25 basis points
- **Key Insight**: Shows government credit risk vs interbank market
- **Crisis Indicator**: Spreads >50bp indicate severe market dislocation

#### 30-Year Spread (Pension Fund Activity)
- **Normal Range**: 15-30 basis points
- **Special Factors**: UK pension fund LDI activity affects long-end spreads
- **Watch For**: Pension fund de-risking events causing spread volatility

**Practical Monitoring:**
- Create spreadsheet tracking daily spreads
- Set alerts for spreads moving >2 standard deviations
- Compare current spreads to 1-year rolling averages

### 2. ETF Arbitrage: Discrepancies Between Gilt ETFs and Underlying Bonds

**Popular UK Gilt ETFs:**
- **iShares Core UK Gilts (IGLT)**: Broad gilt market exposure
- **Vanguard UK Gilt (VGOV)**: Low-cost gilt fund
- **iShares UK Gilts 0-5yr (GILS)**: Short-duration gilts

**How ETF Arbitrage Works:**

#### Premium/Discount Analysis
ETFs should trade close to their Net Asset Value (NAV), but market dynamics can create discrepancies.

**Example Analysis:**
```
IGLT ETF Price: £12.45
IGLT NAV: £12.50
Discount: -0.40% (ETF trading below fair value)

Opportunity Indicators:
- ETF discount >0.5%: Potential buying opportunity
- ETF premium >0.3%: Potential selling opportunity
```

#### Practical Implementation:
1. **Daily NAV Tracking**: Compare ETF closing price to published NAV
2. **Volume Analysis**: Low volume days often show larger premiums/discounts
3. **Creation/Redemption Monitoring**: Large flows indicate institutional arbitrage activity

**Advanced Analysis:**
- **Intraday Premiums**: ETF prices can diverge from indicative NAV during market stress
- **Cross-ETF Analysis**: Compare similar gilt ETFs for relative value
- **Sector Rotation Signals**: Persistent premiums/discounts indicate investor sentiment

### 3. Curve Trading: Buy/Sell Different Maturity Gilts Based on Curve Shape

**Yield Curve Strategies:**

#### Steepener Trade
**Setup**: Expect yield curve to steepen (long rates rise faster than short rates)
- **Action**: Buy short-maturity gilts (2-5Y), sell long-maturity gilts (20-30Y)
- **Rationale**: Short rates anchored by BoE policy, long rates sensitive to growth/inflation

**Example:**
```
Current Curve:
2Y: 4.50%
10Y: 4.20%
30Y: 4.40%

Curve is inverted (unusual)

Steepener Trade:
- Buy 2Y gilt at 4.50%
- Sell 30Y gilt at 4.40%
- Expect: 2Y falls to 3.50%, 30Y rises to 4.80%
- Profit: 100bp on 2Y + 40bp on 30Y = 140bp total
```

#### Flattener Trade
**Setup**: Expect yield curve to flatten (long rates fall relative to short rates)
- **Action**: Sell short-maturity gilts, buy long-maturity gilts
- **Triggers**: Recession fears, BoE hiking cycle ending

#### Butterfly Trades
**Setup**: Exploit mispricing at specific curve points
- **Example**: 5Y-10Y-20Y butterfly
- **Action**: Buy 10Y gilt, sell equal duration amounts of 5Y and 20Y
- **Profit**: When 10Y moves back to fair value relative to wings

**Practical Curve Analysis:**
1. **Daily Curve Plotting**: Graph yields vs maturity
2. **Historical Comparison**: Compare current curve to 1, 3, 6-month ago
3. **Curve Metrics**: Calculate 2s10s spread, 5s30s spread
4. **Policy Cycle Analysis**: Position based on BoE meeting expectations

### 4. Inflation Breakevens: Compare Nominal Gilts vs Inflation-Linked Gilts

**Understanding Breakeven Inflation:**
The breakeven rate is the difference between nominal gilt yields and inflation-linked gilt yields.

**Formula:**
```
10Y Breakeven = 10Y Nominal Gilt Yield - 10Y Index-Linked Gilt Real Yield
```

**Example Calculation:**
```
10Y Nominal Gilt Yield: 4.20%
10Y Index-Linked Gilt Real Yield: 1.30%
10Y Breakeven Inflation: 2.90%

Interpretation: Market expects 2.90% average inflation over 10 years
```

**Key Breakeven Levels:**

#### 5-Year Breakevens
- **Range**: 2.0% - 4.0%
- **Sensitivity**: Highly sensitive to near-term BoE policy
- **Crisis Behavior**: Can spike >5% during energy crises

#### 10-Year Breakevens  
- **Range**: 2.5% - 3.5%
- **Significance**: Long-term inflation expectations anchor
- **BoE Target**: Should anchor around 2% if credible

#### 30-Year Breakevens
- **Range**: 3.0% - 4.0%
- **Factors**: Demographic trends, long-term fiscal sustainability
- **Pension Funds**: Major buyers of inflation protection

**Trading Opportunities:**

#### Breakeven Rich/Cheap Analysis
**Breakevens Too High (>3.5% for 10Y):**
- Market overestimating inflation
- **Trade**: Buy nominal gilts, sell index-linked gilts
- **Catalyst**: Disinflation surprises, BoE credibility restoration

**Breakevens Too Low (<2.0% for 10Y):**
- Market underestimating inflation
- **Trade**: Buy index-linked gilts, sell nominal gilts  
- **Catalyst**: Energy price shocks, wage-price spiral concerns

**Practical Implementation:**
- **iShares UK Index-Linked Gilts ETF (INXG)**: Easy exposure to inflation-linked bonds
- **Breakeven Monitoring**: Track daily breakeven levels vs historical ranges
- **CPI Release Analysis**: Position before/after inflation data releases

## Market Intelligence Value

### Market Stress: Wide Spreads Indicate Dislocation

**Stress Indicators:**

#### Credit Spreads
**Normal Conditions:**
- UK 10Y gilt vs German 10Y bund: 50-100bp
- UK 10Y gilt vs US 10Y treasury: -50bp to +50bp

**Stress Conditions:**
- UK-German spread >150bp: UK-specific stress (Brexit, fiscal policy)
- UK-US spread >100bp: Dollar strength or UK weakness

**Historical Examples:**
```
Brexit Referendum (June 2016):
UK 10Y: 1.35%
German 10Y: 0.05%
Spread: 130bp (elevated stress)

Mini-Budget Crisis (September 2022):
UK 10Y: 4.50%
German 10Y: 2.10%  
Spread: 240bp (extreme stress)
```

#### Swap Spreads
**Definition**: Difference between swap rates and government bond yields

**Normal UK Swap Spreads:**
- 2Y: 5-15bp
- 10Y: 15-25bp
- 30Y: 20-35bp

**Crisis Indicators:**
- Negative swap spreads: Government bonds yielding more than swaps (credit concerns)
- Very wide spreads (>50bp): Liquidity crisis in government bond market

### Liquidity Conditions: Tight Spreads = Healthy Markets

**Bid-Ask Spreads as Liquidity Indicators:**

#### Government Gilt Liquidity
**Normal Bid-Ask Spreads:**
- 2Y, 5Y, 10Y benchmark gilts: 1-2bp
- 30Y gilts: 2-3bp
- Off-the-run gilts: 3-5bp

**Stressed Conditions:**
- Benchmark gilts >5bp: Market making difficult
- Off-the-run >10bp: Severe liquidity shortage

**Example Analysis:**
```
Normal Market (March 2024):
10Y Gilt 4% 2034:
Bid: 98.45 (4.201% yield)
Ask: 98.47 (4.199% yield)
Spread: 2bp

Stressed Market (October 2022):
10Y Gilt 4% 2034:
Bid: 95.20 (4.55% yield)  
Ask: 95.35 (4.52% yield)
Spread: 15bp
```

#### Cross-Market Liquidity
**Gilt-Swap Basis:**
- **Normal**: Gilt yields 10-25bp below equivalent swaps
- **Stress**: Basis can widen to 50bp+ or even turn negative

**Repo Market Indicators:**
- **GC (General Collateral) Repo Rate**: Should trade close to BoE base rate
- **Special Repo Rates**: Specific gilt issues trade below GC when in demand
- **Repo Fails**: High fail rates indicate settlement/liquidity stress

### Policy Expectations: Swap Curves Reflect Rate Expectations

**Forward Rate Analysis:**

#### Extracting BoE Policy Expectations
**Method**: Use swap curve to derive implied forward rates

**Example Calculation:**
```
Current Rates:
1Y Swap: 5.00%
2Y Swap: 4.50%

Implied 1Y Forward Rate in 1 Year:
(4.50% × 2) - (5.00% × 1) = 4.00%

Interpretation: Market expects BoE to cut rates to 4.00% next year
```

**Key Forward Rates to Monitor:**
- **3M vs 6M forwards**: Near-term policy expectations
- **1Y vs 2Y forwards**: Next year's policy path  
- **2Y vs 5Y forwards**: Medium-term neutral rate expectations

#### Meeting-by-Meeting Expectations
**SONIA Futures Analysis:**
- **3M SONIA Futures**: Price in specific BoE meeting outcomes
- **Example**: If 3M future at 95.25, market expects 4.75% rate
- **Pre-Meeting Positioning**: Futures prices converge to actual decisions

**Calendar Spread Trading:**
```
Example: December 2024 vs March 2025 SONIA Futures
Dec 2024: 95.00 (5.00% expected rate)
Mar 2025: 95.25 (4.75% expected rate)  
Spread: 25bp expected cut between meetings
```

### Credit Concerns: Government vs Swap Spreads Show Sovereign Risk

**Sovereign Credit Risk Indicators:**

#### Gilt-Bund Spreads
**Interpretation Guide:**
- **<50bp**: UK credit similar to Germany (AAA equivalent)
- **50-100bp**: Moderate risk premium vs Germany
- **100-150bp**: Elevated UK-specific risks
- **>200bp**: Serious sovereign credit concerns

**Historical Context:**
```
Pre-Financial Crisis (2007): 25bp (minimal spread)
Financial Crisis Peak (2009): 150bp (banking system stress)
Brexit Vote (2016): 120bp (political uncertainty)
Mini-Budget Crisis (2022): 250bp (fiscal credibility loss)
```

#### Currency-Adjusted Analysis
**Real vs Nominal Risk:**
- Compare UK spreads vs other AAA sovereigns
- Adjust for currency hedging costs
- **Example**: UK-German spread vs UK-Canadian spread

**Breakeven Analysis:**
- **5Y UK CDS**: Credit default swap prices
- **Normal Range**: 15-40bp
- **Stress Level**: >75bp indicates credit concerns
