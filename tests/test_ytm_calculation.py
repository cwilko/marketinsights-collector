"""
Tests for YTM calculation logic and bond price validation in gilt market collectors.

These tests validate the recent fixes:
- Removal of coupon rate fallback logic  
- Proper YTM calculation for bonds with short maturities
- Price validation to skip bonds with unrealistic prices
- Error handling that raises exceptions instead of silent failures
